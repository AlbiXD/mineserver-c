# Current Status
Still in early development! 
<br><br>
Right now the client can connect to the server and disconnect just fine. Currently working on packet parsing.

# Build & Run
In order to build this program you must run the makefile with 
```
make
``` 
Then you simply start the server by running 
```
./server.out
```
